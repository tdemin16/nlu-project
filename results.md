## Custom sentences
- My favourite film is 'Wir Kinder von Bahnhof Zoo'. The film is set in Berlin in the 1970s, where the scourge of child prostitution and juvenile drug addiction is told and made known in the western world. It is a film based on a true story, where the main character Christian played by Natja Brunckhorst is the only professional actress, in fact most of the other actors were taken from the streets, so as to make the scenes of the film even more real and crude. This aspect is what makes me love this unfiltered film, where the dark and deeply degraded side of a modern city like Berlin is shown for the first time in the history of cinema.
- Murder on the Orient Express is a 2017 film directed by Kenneth Branagh based on the book of the same name by Agatha Christie. A man is found dead in a carriage of a luxury train travelling through Europe. The journey is then interrupted to find out who the culprit is and Hercule Poirot is the man assigned to solve the mystery. I particularly liked this film because it adhered to the original plot of the book and thus succeeded in leaving the viewer in suspense for the duration of the film. The actors got into the part well and managed to create suspicions in me that were later disproved.
- Parasite is a 2019 Korean film directed by Bong Joon-ho. In the film, a poor family manages to get hired through deception by a rich family by posing as a university student, artist, driver and housekeeper. One day the wealthy family goes on holiday and the other family takes the opportunity to enjoy the luxury of the house, but the party is soon interrupted. Despite winning many awards, the film was unfortunately not to my liking. I felt it lacked content and lacked credibility, so much so that I couldn't wait for it to end. The clash between rich and poor people was developed in a predictable and superficial manner, leaving no message at the end of the film.
- Interstellar is maybe the best movie I have ever watched. The movie is set in the future where diseases are destroying all kinds of harvest. In her bedroom, young Murphy discovers a strange phenomenon related to gravity which will later guide his father to new planets with the hope of finding a new home for humanity. The movie is written by the Nolan brothers, starring Matthew McConaughey, and with Music by Hans Zimmer. Putting these four people together is the recipe for an oscar film. They were even capable of depicturing the best black hole ever seen on the big screen, and the best part of it is that at the time, no photo of a black hole was available. To me, it is a masterpiece and everyone should watch it.
- Don't Look Up is a 2021 film directed by Adam McKay. The movie starts with two astronomers (Leonardo Di Caprio and Jennifer Lawrence) who discover a new meteorite that is directed to earth and that is big enough to extinguish a species. However, the president of the United States (who resembles Donald Trump, although female) together with a Billionaire CEO (which is a mixture of Elon Musk and Steve Jobs) will try to diminish the problem to get votes and money. The cast is composed of Leonardo Di Caprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Timothee Chalamet, Cate Blanchett, Meryl Streep, and Ariana Grande. It seems like they focused on finding the best available actors (and most expensive ones) in order to cover an undeveloped idea. The movie is so unrealistic that I had to force myself in order to finish it, and I cannot understand how it is possible that everyone found it a great movie. The director wants to explain how, nowadays, we don't care enough about natural phenomena that could lead to extinction. However, he does it too forcely making it a ridiculous film.
- Luca is an animation movie who I would recommend to anyone! The movie is placed in Cinque Terre, Italy, and the set is incredibly realistic. The only thing I didn’t appreciate was the use of Italian words mixed with other languages (ofc it doesn’t happen if you watch it in Italian).
- The action movie ARMY OF ZOMBIES is supposed to be the sequel of the movie ARMY of THief but it hasn’t really anything to do with this one. The only thing they both have in common is that the goal is to open a super complicated safe and become rich. It is placed in Las Vegas. I wouldn’t recommend it, I didn’t like it because it’s boring. I would say to only watch the first one.

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann ' s forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he ' s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach ' s hidden agenda . cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he ' s a beast , but ashamed of it . ) l . i . e . would have worked best as a half - hour short film about howie ' s ill - advised foray into big john ' s haven . rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . we ' re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it ' s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . the restraint is admirable . but l . i . e . ' s screenplay doesn ' t always give them the best material . when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach ' s goldberg variations . it ' s too much . this plot thread predictably leads to violence . not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff ' s superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . it ' s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . in this regard , l . i . e . ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle ' s attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play " rain " , based on w . somerset maugham ' s story " miss thompson " cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly - restored version of frank capra ' s lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen -- little awkwardness , and a very clever script . the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie ' s soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live - action film , or the original script . the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham ' s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ' ve been waiting an hour and a half for . still , it ' s entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore ' s incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . perhaps economic content is a better word -- it certainly doesn ' t show capitalism in a good light . as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . not that it wasn ' t interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop - animation that is very well done . all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts -- except for the animated stuffed rats . boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn ' t it ? add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . some gore . don ' t bring children to this one . don ' t bring adults to this one , unless they ' re fascinated by puppetry and / or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . blech . . no fun whatsoever . of course , something goes wrong -- and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . c -- $ 2 . 50 . the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie - going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i ' ve learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : 1 ) be wary of french comedies . these people like jerry lewis . 2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . 3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as " old pouty - lips " is probably not worth watching . 4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible -- witness malcolm last year ) task . well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . it ' s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 ' s about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b & w -- everything seems sepia - colored anyway . actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that ' s life . grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you ' re looking for inadvertent yuks . 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green ' s primal scream . it ' s clear that " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) . while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there ' s little about green ' s mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else . the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols ' ' problem ' ( green ' s put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times . green ' s flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the ' daddy would you like some sausages ' scene repeatedly shown in the film ' s trailer ) are inspired comedy . a baby delivery bit shows some groan - inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs . younger ( by three years ) brother freddy ' s internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one ' s worst fears regarding the film ' s title and green ' s infamous ' handling ' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn ' t make sense . by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film ' s end , the overall effect is numbness . while " freddy got fingered " has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child ' s self esteem , it ' s essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy . 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink - and - a - concussive - nudge bombast - o - rama con air . if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim - witted and ridiculous , and that he ' s going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed - up version of raising arizona ' s h . i . mcdonnough . he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there ' s one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it ' s that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage ' s performance . while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage ' s goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . audiences , too , should know what they ' re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . no one who loathed the rock for its swear - grunt - blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab ' s soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline / testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it ' s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . what he doesn ' t deliver is a moment of suspense . a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock ' s notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air ' s creepiest set - up . their tete - a - tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . it doesn ' t bode well for cage ' s appearance in face / off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . . . repeat offender . 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  for " original sin , " the road to the screen has been rocky . initially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . yes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t & a ( with angelina jolie providing the " t " and antonio banderas the " a " ) . more importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . veteran readers know that , as a rule , i don ' t encourage people to patronize lousy films . most of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the " let ' s go laugh at the failings of others " mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . quality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i ' m concerned , it ' s fair to find our kicks where we may . " original sin " will never join such treasures as " valley of the dolls , " " road house " and " showgirls " in the bad movie hall of fame , but it ' ll do until something worse comes along . jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers ' insistence on using one of banderas ' legs to cover jolie ' s crotch makes it look like he ' s trying to climb her . incidentally , if you ' re afraid i ' m giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . oh , the pathos of it all . the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly . banderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) . if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene . and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them " original sin . " 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  it ' s not a bad thing to update old stories . the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed , it ' s that it ' s dry . although the story is updated , you know the plot . the movie is often like watching a filmed play . theater in real life is engrossing . theater on the screen is usually lifeless . the camera can be a star of films . here it ' s a co - conspirator . the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish . huston is enjoyable in her over - the - top wickedness . in all fairness , my companion loved the film . maybe it ' s one of those " chick flicks " that men don ' t like . it is certainly a date film . oh well , maybe it ' s good for something . 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  i can ' t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over - wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer - director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . it does a great job of setting up jjaks ' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves ' wounded look is just right for jjaks . the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements ' " i will dare " on the car radio . you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn ' t expect what i got . what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . vincent d ' onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme ' s something wild and neil jordan ' s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn ' t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . i don ' t want to dismiss baigelman ' s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well - crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light - hearted caper . feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there ' s not much funny about that . 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  i cried during _babe_ . i admit it . the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a " children ' s film " -- so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental . such , my friend , is the power of cinema . when word came out that they were using this newly developed f / x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations . can ' t miss . can ' t possibly miss . after much thought , i supply three general rules . ( 1 ) don ' t let a television actress - turned - comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall ' s dreadful " preacher ' s wife " ) . betty thomas worked wonders with " the brady bunch movie " , but the same sitcom - airiness doesn ' t quite work here . it ' s as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r & b . take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid - 80 ' s kirk cameron show . ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast - member has to do ( i . e . , " con air " ) . it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one - line - at - a - time . it ' s even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don ' t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he ' s in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . but there ' s little humor here . that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise - ass guinea pig . even the mouth is ill - synched . ( 3 ) don ' t let the special effects technicians walk away with the script . there ' s a certain timing that ' s mandatory in comedy . to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson ' s creature shop , is a travesty . this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren ' t well - timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have . here , betty thomas is clearly over her head . i wish i could commend the special effects , but they ' re merely average . count the number of times where the animal ' s mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill - synched . this is less a " babe " and more of a " look who ' s barking " clone . you may be wondering , ' how does eddie murphy fare ? ' well , he came back with the exceptional " nutty professor " , and i don ' t doubt he can come back again . it ' s unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years . butt jokes . a _lot_ of butt jokes . i guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone - faced . if there ' s a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt . 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  my giant begins with a monologue that ' s more funny than not and a distinctive ' princess bride , ' medieval fairy - tale - in - the - ? 90s feel . i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . and when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . the film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max - sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . i also liked jere burns ' ( from tv ' s ' something so right ' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . at this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast - paced first scene . it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . however , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . off the high board . if he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . indeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . at this point i found myself thinking , ' we ' re supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' in the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . i found this scene offensive . not only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . i think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . this could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy ' s transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! ' my giant ' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max ' s struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy ' s struggles to get money and become a better person . in this scenario , max ' s illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . instead , we ' re apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we ' re not allowed to focus on max . crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , ` my giant ' left me feeling like i ' d been fed gruel from a giant spoon . 

* **Pred: 1 - GT: 0**:  for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two - hour long episode of magyuver . and not a particularly good one at that . mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it ' ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise ' s firing gun just so they can die really cool . in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi - stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other ' s eyes with come hither sexuality ? i haven ' t the foggiest . i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . it ' s possible that these " spies " could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . the scenes i ' ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial - like visuals . still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . sure it ' s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that ' s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . newton bats her eyes flirtatiously . here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . he ' s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90 ' s ) . sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise ' s initial " i ' m the man ! " charm and more slo - mo close - ups of his preening mug . mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won ' t stop . the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could ' ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the " symbolic " pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . we ' ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . he ' s cool for sure but he ' s made to be as empty as the movie . the actor isn ' t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . when he ' s not beaming away , he ' s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo ' s editing seriously undermines the effort . he fetishizes cruise ' s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he ' s really austin powers . in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin - up boy angel of death . what a hero ! you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2 ' s plot . my reasoning is simple : i ' m not sure of any good it would do . the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next " special " effect . i wasn ' t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . in mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma ' s ( that film ' s director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo ' s non - stop masturbatory pandemonium . it ' s irrelevant in every sense , as is character . all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors .

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  call it touched by a demon . if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . in fact , there ' s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion ' s share of the weirdness distilled out . the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it ' s consistently interesting , it ' s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . the most famous landmark to appear isn ' t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it ' s geno ' s steaks . fallen ' s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring . washington ' s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . it ' s not that he ' s bad per se , but he ' s not very interesting . there ' s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life - or - death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . washington ' s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler ' s list ) and donald sutherland . to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren ' t all acting - related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well - written . that said , however , there ' s nothing inspired about either davidtz ' s or sutherland ' s work . both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi - dimensional individual . narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game - like structure , it uses a denzel washington - supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like " i like the night ? in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . however , despite the negatives , i ' m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . it ' s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it ' s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . and , whatever you do , don ' t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer . it ' s pretty good in it ' s own right , yes , but i would probably split the " best movie " honors among face / off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon . it ' s main problem is that it ' s quickly forgettable , and i can ' t remember one truly good scene from it . and all of face / off was pretty dang good . but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches . i remember it not for it ' s humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted . and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i ' ll touch on in a later review . back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren ' t comic - geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy ' s life is to boy scots . okay , that one was pretty pathetic . ) few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest - politician - rare , very hard to find . all i can say is , thank god they didn ' t cast chris o ' donnell . i know i can ' t be the only person on the planet who thinks he ' s an annoying , preppie little snot . . . sorry . my apologies to o ' donnell fans . i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely . hmm . . . . so now you ' re probably wondering why i ' ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years . good question . i ' ll move on to the movie now . not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven ' t seen this movie , but a basically - big - roach - type - bug lands in a redneck farmer ' s yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe . not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that . i ' m not even really paying attention anymore . ) the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black . i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the " cool weapons " they had . the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said . and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln ' t have . this movie was basically a " black comedy " , not an action / sci - fi like i expected from the trailers . don ' t get me wrong on what i think of this movie . it ' s not bad , i gave it * * * . it was mostly entertaining throughout it ' s run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it . my diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket . of course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that ' s beside the point . i think .

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? naturally we don ' t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . secondly , and along the same line , we can ' t prejudge a film because of it ' s stars , director , etc . well , in the first one , we ' d go into a film thinking it ' s going to be dumb or it ' s going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i ' m not expecting much ) . on the second hand , we ' re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal " grudge " against the film company ( it ' s made by disney ? oh , it ' s just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey ' s in it ? it ' s gonna stink ! ) can ' t be that good ) . this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . isn ' t that kind of along the same lines ? when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer ' s credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? i think it is , and i ' ll tell you why . a good critic should be able to view the film from the " average joe ( or jane ) " viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . the acting was superb , but i was bored " or " i loved it ! ! it was sooooo cheezy ! " might be used to describe a film . these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we ' re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . every average person out there who ' s interested in this film is likely to ask " how does it compare to pulp fiction ? " and so , as a critic , i ' m already responsible to ask that same question . jackie brown stars pam grier , the " blaxploitation " heroine from the 1970 ' s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . tarantino ' s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta ' s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . ( we ' ve made it thru comparison # 1 ! ) coming into play is another 70 ' s veteran , robert forster as jackie ' s bail bondsmen max cherry . max ' s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there ' s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn ' t need a de niro to play him . compared to pulp fiction ( comparison # 3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn ' t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly - jarred perception of life . jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn ' t as awesome as the first time . jules was the rambling , bible - quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don ' t think he ' s quite as irreplaceable . jackson could ' ve remained tarantino ' s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn ' t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . this is grier ' s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino ' s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard ' s novel " rum punch " . for those movie - goers , don ' t expect another pulp fiction and you ' ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90 ' s film - making . the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we ' re still reminded that this is tarantino ' s movie thanks to odd split - screen story - telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn ' t pulp fiction at all . it ' s good , but it isn ' t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won ' t satiate true fans . if you can realize that this isn ' t going to knock your socks off , then you ' ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . after all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy .

" crash " is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue . while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization . not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don ' t really see a lot of the actors completely exposed . but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience . this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of " henry and june " or the just plain horniness of , say , " deep throat " ( not that i ' ve seen it ) . if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole " auto eroticism " thing . the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge . suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt ' show all this though , even if it is nc - 17 ) . while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge . while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who ' s main fetish is living on the edge . i ' m sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don ' t see a connection between car crashes and sex . the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush . his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini - masterpieces : we ' re at first not sure if they ' ll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp . these people are merely taking it to another level . the only problem with the film is that it ' s a tad redundant . a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half . this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long . there ' s no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it ' s a porn , and we ' re not here to sympathize . but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements . the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling . and there are several scenes are just amazing . a sequence involving one character ' s death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs . the acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) . while james spader is pretty boring ( he ' s usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing . she speaks all her words in almost zombie - like hushes , and when she ' s having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she ' s enjoying it or not . holly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) . but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone . he has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he ' s taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he ' s getting a freaky tatoo . kosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in " teenage mutant ninja turtles " ) , but here he shows a deniro - like presence , hinting that he ' s capable of bigger roles . while i hardly enjoyed " crash , " it ' s still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world . these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn ' t exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out . despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc - 17 rating ( there ' s also an r - rated version , but i wouldn ' t even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn - on should just rent a regular porno . 

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  deep rising is one of " those " movies . the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us . it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that , it says boldly , let ' s see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors . heh ! them wacky monsters , gotta love ' em . of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra " oumph " to get people in theaters . that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing . let me explain : despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good ' ol b movie . luckily , it ' s a very good b movie . the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie ' s bread and butter . therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre . we just don ' t know when or how horrible it will be . i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high . imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times . a funny b movie ? well , that ' s new . these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh . ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . ) and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen . i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies . cool . so far so good . wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim . comic relief . . . let him live . ) after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home . i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew . suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went " ewwww " about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing . i ' m a man , we nottice these things . all in all , i ' d recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door . . . but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you . the acting is decent , the effects top rate . how to best describe it ? put together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming " don ' t go there , he ' s behind you " and you end up with deep rising . for creepy crawly goodness , tight t - shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water . 

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  capsule : trippy , hyperspeed action machine from hong kong ' s accomplished tsui hark . van damme and rodman have nice chemistry , the stunts are eyepopping , and stuff gets blowed up real good ; what more do you want ? i admit i was all set to loathe double team ; it reeked of cheapjack timing - oriented marketing ( stick dennis rodman in a movie , quick , while he ' s hot , and do something about jean - claude van damme ' s flagging career while we ' re at it ! ) surprise -- double team transcends its dumb roots and turns out to be a mess of fun . van damme is jack quinn , an ex - agent who is brought back in for " one last mission " -- you ' d think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words . in the first showdown between quinn and stavros , the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve : nonstop action . all become arenas for some of the most bone - rattling shoot - outs and punch - outs filmed . they are better seen than described and are reason enough to see the film : one jaw - dropping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his * feet * . ( van damme is a good , dextrous athlete and fighter , but he is often upstaged . ) there are other nice touches . one of the things about hk action movies is that there ' s always some form of human element , and that ' s carried over into this movie as well . it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable . also good is dennis rodman , playing a weapons dealer named yaz -- a character who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers and who is funny just standing there . rodman is natural on screen ; he ' s fun to watch , especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs , and deserves to get a movie of his own , based on what ' s seen here : a lightweight , fast - moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently . 

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug . 26th / 1998 ) starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert in " the heartbreak kid " , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i ' ve seen on screen in a long time . i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film . the end of " the heartbreak kid " is both hilarious and sad for that very reason . charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin ' s desire . she owns every scene that she ' s in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do . " the heartbreak kid " was written by neil simon and it shows . simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he ' s at the top of his game here . as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he ' s the type of guy that everyone knows . the character of george costanza on " seinfeld " seems to have been modelled after him . the only problem with the film is that it ' s not that funny , and it ' s billed as a comedy . as much as i could see the realism in the characters , it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there . " the heartbreak kid " is not a date movie . it has an extremely negative view of relationships , so seeing it with a girlfriend / boyfriend , could be hazardus to your health . 

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . this perhaps may be washington ' s very best to date . his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting " the hurricane " a much better film than it actually is . the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america ' s history . the problem with " the hurricane " is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . this is , without a doubt , washington ' s movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . we see an emotional boxing match inside carter ' s head . it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . if only the other actors had this same determination . dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . it felt like his character was taken straight out of a " scooby doo " episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn ' t for those annoying little kids . " the kids " in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in " clueless , " same for david paymer in " get shorty , " harris yulin in " ghostbusters " and liev schreiber in " the daytrippers . " it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin " hurricane " carter . this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get . 

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . it doesn ' t do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line . many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek - fan - only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham ' s aliens who number only a couple of dozen . so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that ' s plausible . but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . no problem so far . in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren ' t hanging on every word on the screen . my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non - trekkies . the special effects are among the best for the star trek series . the action is plentiful and well done . this is a very good - looking movie . it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series . if you ' ve always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind . star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones . 

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas ' s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . we ' re the fans , not the freaks . we won ' t go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won ' t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we ' re throwing down . all right , stop looking at me like that . we have been faithfully and patiently waiting . waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . anything less and it ' ll be the biggest disappointment of the century . i didn ' t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn ' t , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . character development is virtually nonexistent . with the possible exception of qui - gon , most of the film ' s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . jar jar ' s life is saved by qui - gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . his speech mannerisms are so " cute - ified " that i couldn ' t understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . in star wars , we had obi - wan telling us mos eisley was a " wretched hive of scum and villainy . " in the phantom menace , we get doo doo . the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story " a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . " this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it ' s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it ' s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500 - like play by play . i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? didn ' t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? didn ' t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? of course they did , and it ' s only poor judgment that allows the most - eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . the people at lucas ' s industrial light and magic , the world ' s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer - generated images and real - life footage . some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation ' s robot army and jar jar ' s countrymen . the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine - episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi - wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . one of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film ' s release . in spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn ' t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story - writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real - life connection . oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force - loving parasites in your body ' s cells . this only serves to de - mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . don ' t let me mislead you too far . the phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . it contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . it ' s just that when held up to it ' s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . 

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn ' t require a magical faster - than - light drive . she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then - unknown julie christie . audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . dennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well - structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . feldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . now , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . species features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly - written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . ( note that , in the 1970 ' s , we really didn ' t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . the first half of the film has something to offer , as " sil , " the alien girl , struggles with her multi - form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . whitaker ' s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation ' s " counselor cleavage . " kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . h . r . giger ' s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . the main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn ' t live up to it . all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . there is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of " scare " scenes stuck together . the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . on the other hand , as an exercise in sci - fi action / adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it ' s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . my personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don ' t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . 

* **Pred: 0 - GT: 1**:  armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . stories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . armageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you ' ll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . but i loved every freaking minute of it . believe me , i ' m just as shocked as you are . hell , i don ' t even know why i went to see it in the first place . the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . i ' m sorry , but " somebody dial 911 ! isn ' t quite the tagging that ' s going to sell a movie . it isn ' t too wise either to market the film using the movie ' s stupidest lines ( " beam me up scotty " - yeah , that sure is great writing . i mean , let ' s face it ; armageddon ' s previews rival the truman show ' s as being some of the worst of the year . in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can ' t quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . as i said , this is hardly a film about plot . it ' s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . case in point : nasa doesn ' t know that there is even an asteroid on it ' s way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? how pretentious is that ? ? did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin ' time at the movies . and don ' t get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . so even if you don ' t win one of mcdonald ' s free tickets , it ' s still definitely worth checking out .
